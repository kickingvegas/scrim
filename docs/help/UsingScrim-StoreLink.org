* Share Links to Emacs with Org Protocol

** Storing & Pasting an Org Link via ~open~
Let’s start with sending an Org link (in this case, https://melpa.org) to Emacs.

First, open the Terminal app in the ~/Applications/Utilities~ folder.

Copy, paste, and run the following string into the command line.

#+begin_example
  open "org-protocol://store-link?title=MELPA&url=https://melpa.org"
#+end_example

You should see the following message in your Emacs mini-buffer:

#+HTML: <img src="images/insert-org-link-minibuffer.png" width="80%" style="border: solid thin;"/>

This message lets you know that the Org link has been stored by Emacs. Org links are stored in a LIFO ("Last In, First Out") queue. They can be pasted into an Org buffer using the following commands:

- ~org-insert-last-stored-link~ (binding: ~C-c M-l~)
- ~org-insert-link~ (binding: ~C-c C-l~)

In Emacs, open an Org buffer and use the binding  ~C-c M-l~ to paste the link. You should see the link [[https://melpa.org][MELPA]] in your Org buffer.

As the mini-buffer message states, if you only want the URL, you can paste the link using ~C-y~.

** macOS Integration

Users familiar with ~emacsclient~ may seem unimpressed at this point, as the ~open~ command is substituted for it in the above example. However, programs run in the Terminal app have their security privileges /escalated/. Native macOS apps by default can /not/ call ~emacsclient~ because they do not have the security privilege to do so.

Let's exercise *Scrim* from a macOS app then, in this case with the TextEdit app.

- Open the TextEdit app in the ~/Applications~ folder, and create a new document.
- Copy the following Org Protocol URL:
#+begin_example
     org-protocol://store-link?title=MELPA&url=https://melpa.org
#+end_example
- In the new document, from the menu bar select “Edit › Add Link…”.
- A dialog will appear. Paste the Org Protocol URL into it and click “OK”.
- You should see the following result in the new document.
#+HTML: <img src="images/TextEdit-OrgLink.png" width="80%"/>

Note that the Org Protocol link in the TextEdit document is “live” - clicking on it will store the MELPA link in Emacs just as in the example above.
