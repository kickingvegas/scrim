*Scrim* is an [[file:OrgProtocol.org::*Org Protocol][Org Protocol]] proxy for Emacs on macOS.

With *Scrim*, 3^{rd} party native apps can send links and text clippings to an Emacs Org file by simply opening a custom URL scheme (~org‑protocol://~).

*Scrim* is a native app that is designed to work with the security policies of macOS. No workarounds that involve relaxing security policy is required.

While *Scrim* can work with any program that is capable of generating an ~org‑protocol://~ request, it is intended to work in tandem with [[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/captee/id6446053750][Captee]], a utility to share links and text clippings from the macOS Share Menu, which many native macOS apps support.

* Features
- Send links and text clippings to an Emacs Org file via [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Protocols.html][Org Protocol]].
- Open or create files on your local file system in Emacs via the ~scrim://~ custom URL scheme.
- Open Emacs Info pages (nodes) via the ~scrim://~ custom URL scheme.
  
* Requirements
- macOS 15.x (Sequoia)
- *Scrim* is designed to work directly with the GNU Free Software Foundation version of Emacs 29.4+.
  - The [[https://bitbucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac/src/master/][Mitsuharu Yamamoto fork (aka Emacs Mac App)]] has been modified to natively support ~org‑protocol://~. If you use it, you do not need *Scrim*.
- Your local setup of Emacs must run /server/ to support ~org‑protocol://~.
  - In addition, /server/ must be setup to use a TCP socket.
